Show Groups For User - ServiceNow

Hello developers!

I created this catalog item that consists of three fields, one for users, one for text type groups, and one for reference type groups.

In this catalog item, when you choose a user, the two groups fields are filled with all the groups that the selected user is in.

I use an Include Script with a function to return the groups and another function to return a query with the group IDs of the selected user. With Client Script I fill the groups field with the text type, and with Reference Qualifier I fill the groups field with the Reference type.
